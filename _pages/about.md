I am a full Stack developer based in Pune, India. I have a bachelor's degree in computer science and engineering from Pune University, India. 

I am passionate about building stuff. I am a part of local Ruby community. I have built a wide variety of web applications with Ruby on Rails at the backend and JQuery and ReactJS at the frontend. Apart from programming I love reading, going on hikes and eating stuff. I am a big fan of snacks.
